# Different views regarding data security

In this document, I will discuss two articles providing different insights about evolution of database in current world. Harvard Business Review discusses the serious issue of cybersecurity and the increasing number of data breaches; Datamation explores the advancements in database technology, highlighting how these systems are adapting to new demands. 

## Article 1

[The New Rules of Data Privacy](https://hbr.org/2022/02/the-new-rules-of-data-privacy) from Harvard Business Review talks about how cybersecurity is a big problem these days, with more and more data breaches happening. It says companies need to get better at protecting their data because the ways hackers attack are always changing. Thereâ€™s a lot of focus on how many data breaches happened in 2022 and how much information got leaked.

Reading this article made me quite worried. It's shocking how many data breaches there are and how companies struggle to keep our data safe. This article is like a warning that both companies and we need to be more careful with our data.

## Article 2

[Top 5 Current Database Trends](https://www.datamation.com/cloud/current-database-trends/) from Datamation talks about the latest trends in databases, like moving to the cloud, using artificial intelligence to manage databases, and new kinds of databases that are faster and more secure. It explains how these new technologies make handling large amounts of data better and safer.

I found this article really interesting. It's cool to see how databases are getting better, especially with things like AI and cloud storage. It's good to know that as we have more data, there are better ways to keep it safe and use it effectively.
